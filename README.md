# My-Semester-Projects

**Project 1: Name Generator**
**Summary:** The user inputs a yes or no response to questions to learn which character they are from the show "Gilmore Girls". Based on their choices, they will be told which character they are.
**Key takaways:**
This project helped me learn if statements, and user inputs.

**Project 2: Ideal Dog Breed Finder**
**Summary:** This program lets the user decide whether they would like to search a breed by the name, or by traits they would like. Based on their input they will be recommended a breed, and told traits about that deal.
**Key takeaways:**
I learned how to use lists and index numbers, to retrieve specific information. I also learned how to use a list to find specific results. 

**Project 3: Create Project**
**Summary:** This program searches up a game name based on the name a user inputs, or based off of the game specifics the user chooses. Once the computer finds a match to the inputs through a loop, it prints out the results, and information about that specific game.
**Key Takeaways:** 
I learned how to find specific information in a list through a loop, and print out the resulting information from multiple loops using a string. 

**Project 4: Slot Machine**
**Summary:**
In this project we created a slot machine, using a loop and random. The user has a limited number of credits to use per spin, and their goal is to get a jackpot. If the symbols in the list are matching they get a jackpot, and get new credits in return.
**Key Takeaways:**
I learned how to use random in a list, as well as apply parameters to random functions. This program also tought me how to keep track of credits every time the user used them.

**Project 5: Random Movie Recommender**
**Summary:**
This program asks the user for an input of whether they would like a reccomendation. When the user says yes, the program randomly chooses a movie from the movie list and explanations list, and prints the movie cover, as well as a description of the movie.
**Key Takeaways:**
In this project I learned how to put images into my code, and use a lists index to match up information.
